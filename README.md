This is the Module 11 Challenge for the two deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

I have utilised the Zoom class materials and parts of the code on GitLab as well as Xpert Learning Assistant. This can be found in Deliverable 2 for the creation of the dataframe.
